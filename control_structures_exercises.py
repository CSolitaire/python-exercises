#     prompt the user for a day of the week, print out whether the day is Monday or not

response = input("What day of the week is today?")
if response.lower().strip() == "monday":
    print ("It is Monday")
else:
    print("Too bad it's not Monday...")
print("Thank You!, Have a nice day!")
   

#     prompt the user for a day of the week, print out whether the day is a weekday or a weekend





#     create variables and make up values for
#         the number of hours worked in one week
#         the hourly rate
#         how much the week's paycheck will be

#     write the python code that calculates the weekly paycheck. You get paid time and a half if you work more than 40 hours
